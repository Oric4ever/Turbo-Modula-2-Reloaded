Caution! Only build a system if you know what you do !

Two systems are ready to be built here.

The first one integrates the editor and a part of the compiler in overlays, like the
original Turbo Modula-2 did.

It can be build with the following command:

LINK SHELLRES <LINKSYS3.TXT
Output file: SYSTEM.SYS
Include all needed modules (Y/N) ? N


Then finalize the binary image with FINALIZE:

Linked file (without .SYS extension): SYSTEM
Name of Kernel module: KERNEL3

This produces a SYSTEM.BIN binary that can be tested with

RUNSYS SYSTEM.BIN

or permanently installed into the reserved sectors of the disk (Caution!) with INSTALL:
System filename (without BIN extension): SYSTEM
